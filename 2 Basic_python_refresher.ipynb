    "## 4. Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent data and functionality. In Python, you can define classes to create objects that encapsulate data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite abstract for beginners and I don't use them often, but here are some key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Class`: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have. Think of a class as a template for creating objects. For example, a `Car` class might have attributes like `color`, `model`, and methods like `start()` and `stop()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Object`: An instance of a class. It is created from a class and can have its own unique attribute values. For example, you can create an object `my_car` from the `Car` class, and it might have the attributes `color='red'` and `model='Toyota'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Attribute`: A variable that belongs to an object. It represents the state or properties of the object. For example, `color` and `model` in the `Car` class are attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Method`: **A function** that belongs to a specificobject. It defines the behavior of the object. For example, `start()` and `stop()` in the `Car` class are methods. Methods and functions are similar, but methods are associated with a specific object and can access its attributes. It is a common for newbies to confuse methods with functions, but the key difference is that methods are defined within a class and operate on instances of that class, whereas functions are standalone and can be called independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Inheritance`: A way to create a new class based on an existing class. The new class (subclass) inherits attributes and methods from the existing class (superclass). This allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes. For example, you can create a `ElectricCar` class that inherits from the `Car` class, adding new attributes like `battery_size` and methods like `charge()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `self`: A reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access attributes and methods of the class within its own methods. It is similar to `this` in other programming languages. It is very confusing for beginners, but just remember that `self` is always the first parameter of instance methods in a class, and it refers to the object itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `instance` or `object`: These terms are often used interchangeably in OOP. An instance is a specific realization of a class, while an object is a more general term that refers to any entity that has state and behavior. In practice, when you create an object from a class, you are creating an instance of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we think in OOP, it means we are focusing on some objects and their attributes and behaviors, rather than just functions and procedures. For example, an animal can be an object with attributes like species, age, and color, and behaviors like eat, sleep, and make_sound. The behaviors are represented as methods in the class definition, and the attributes are represented as instance variables. "

    "## 5. Error Handling\n",
    "Error handling is an important aspect of programming that allows you to gracefully handle unexpected situations or errors that may occur during the execution of your code. In Python, you can use `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **try block**: Contains the code that may raise an exception. If an exception occurs, the code in the `try` block stops executing, and control is transferred to the `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **except block**: Contains the code that handles the exception. You can specify the type of exception you want to catch, or use a generic `except` to catch all exceptions. You can also have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **else block**: Optional block that runs if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block. It is useful for code that should only run if the `try` block was successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **finally block**: Optional block that always runs, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical structure of error handling in Python looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    # Handling specific exception\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    # Handling generic exception\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to run if no exceptions were raised\n",
    "    print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code that always runs\n",
    "    print(\"Cleanup actions can be performed here.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling is another confusing yet important concept for beginners like me. The try block is where you put the code that might cause an error, and the except block is where you handle the error if it occurs. The errors are either predefined exceptions like `ZeroDivisionError` or custom exceptions that you can define yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to handle a file not found error, you can use `FileNotFoundError` in the except block. The else block is optional and runs if no exceptions were raised in the try block, while the finally block always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is often used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    file = open(\"non_existent_file.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    # Handling specific exception\n",
    "    print(\"Error: The file does not exist.\")\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    # Handling generic exception\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to run if no exceptions were raised\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)finally:\n",
    "    # Code that always runs\n",
    "    print(\"Cleanup actions can be performed here.\")\n",

    "## 6. Boolean Logic and Conditional Statements\n",
    "Boolean logic is a fundamental concept in programming that deals with true/false values. In Python, boolean values are represented by the keywords `True` and `False`. Boolean logic is used to control the flow of a program, make decisions, and perform conditional operations.\n",
    "Boolean expressions are expressions that evaluate to either `True` or `False`. They can be created using comparison operators (like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) and logical operators (like `and`, `or`, `not`).\n",

    "- **Comparison Operators**: Used to compare values and return a boolean result.\n",

    "\n",
    "  - `!=`: Not equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `<`: Less than\n",

    "  - `<=`: Less than or equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `>=`: Greater than or equal to\n",

    "- **Logical Operators**: Used to combine boolean expressions.\n",

    "\n",
    "  - `not`: Returns `True` if the operand is false, and vice versa\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean logic is often used in conditional statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. For example, you can use boolean expressions to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero, and then execute different code blocks based on the result.\n",

    "Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. Python provides two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.\n",
    "- **for loop**: Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or any iterable object. It executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",

    "- **break statement**: Used to exit a loop prematurely when a certain condition is met. It can be used in both `for` and `while` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **continue statement**: Used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **else clause**: An optional clause that can be added to a loop. It executes after the loop completes normally (i.e., not terminated by a `break` statement). It is often used to perform actions after the loop has finished iterating over all items in a sequence.\n",
