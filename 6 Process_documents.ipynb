    "# Process Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step for RAG usually involves processing the documents to extract relevant information and metadata. This can include tasks such as text extraction, summarization, and the generation of embeddings for semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are several main types of document we will process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Documents**: These include articles, reports, and any other form of written content. The focus here is on extracting key information and generating embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Images**: For image documents, we may use techniques such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text, as well as image embeddings to capture visual features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Structured Data**: This includes data from spreadsheets, databases, and other structured formats. The goal is to extract relevant fields and generate embeddings that represent the data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Audio/Video**: For multimedia documents, we may need to transcribe audio or extract key frames from video to process the content effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traps\n",
    "\n",
    "By processing these different types of documents, we can create a rich set of metadata and embeddings that will enhance the RAG system's ability to retrieve and generate relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as a newbie, I learned the hard way that it is impossible to learn to process all types of documents all at once, at least not for me. I tried and failed multiple times before I give up. It is important to take baby steps and focus on one document type at a time, gradually expanding my skills and knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will just focus on processing text documents and maybe a little bit of OCR for now.\n"

    "\n",
    "There are several formats of text documents that we can process, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Plain Text`: Simple text files without any formatting (e.g., .txt).\n",

    "- `Markdown`: Text files with simple formatting (e.g., .md).\n",

    "- `HTML`: Web pages and other documents written in HTML.\n",
