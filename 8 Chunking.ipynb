    "# Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Chunking is the process of breaking down large documents into smaller, manageable pieces or \"chunks.\" This is particularly useful in the context of information retrieval and natural language processing, where working with smaller segments of text can improve the efficiency and accuracy of various tasks, such as search, summarization, and question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used to think chunking is a simple task, as it is just breaking down a document into smaller pieces. However, I have learned that chunking can be pretty tricky, and it does affect the performance of the downstream tasks. You do not want to have too small chunks, nor too large chunks. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some common trade-offs to consider when chunking documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chunk Size**: Smaller chunks may lead to more precise information retrieval but can also result in loss of context. Larger chunks retain more context but may include irrelevant information. Super large chunks will just dilute the information and pile up the token usage in later stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining context is crucial for understanding the meaning of text. If chunks are too small, they may not provide enough context for accurate interpretation. Fix-sized chunks normally have this issue, as the meaning of a sentence can be lost if it is cut off in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overlapping Chunks**: Sometimes, overlapping chunks can help preserve context by ensuring that important information is not lost between adjacent chunks. However, this can also lead to redundancy and increased processing time.\n"
