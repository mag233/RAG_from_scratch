      "Question: What is EBM?\n",
      "EBM most commonly means Evidence‑Based Medicine. Briefly:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Evidence‑Based Medicine (EBM) is the practice of making clinical decisions by integrating three things: the best available research evidence, the clinician’s clinical expertise, and the patient’s values and preferences.  \n",
      "- Typical steps: formulate a focused clinical question, search for relevant evidence, critically appraise that evidence for validity and applicability, apply the evidence together with clinical judgment and patient preferences, and evaluate outcomes.  \n",
      "- Benefits: improves patient outcomes, reduces ineffective or harmful practices, and helps standardize care.  \n",
      "- Limitations: imperfect or absent evidence for many questions, variable quality of studies, and challenges integrating individual patient circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other common meanings (in case you meant one of these):\n",
      "- Electronic Body Music (EBM): a late‑1970s/1980s electronic/industrial dance music genre (bands like Front 242, Nitzer Ebb).  \n",
      "- Energy‑Based Model (EBM): in machine learning, a class of models that assign an energy (unnormalized score) to configurations — used in generative modeling.  \n",
      "- Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM): an interpretable ML model (a form of generalized additive model with pairwise interactions) often used when interpretability is required.\n",
