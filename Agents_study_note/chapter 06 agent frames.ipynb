    "# 智能体框架 Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "照例先感谢Datawhale的课程：https://datawhalechina.github.io/hello-agents/#/./chapter6/%E7%AC%AC%E5%85%AD%E7%AB%A0%20%E6%A1%86%E6%9E%B6%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E5%AE%9E%E8%B7%B5\n",
    "\n",
    "课程介绍了四种主流的智能体框架：\n",
    "\n",
    "- Autogen\n",
    "\n",
    "- AgentScope\n",
    "\n",
    "- CAMEL\n",
    "\n",
    "- LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "每个框架都有自己优缺点，教程里都有，不再复述。重点还是实践。\n",
    "\n",
    "从自己最感兴趣的开始，首先是LangGraph。\n",
    "\n",
    "## LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "最重要的概念是graph，图。图由节点（node）和边（edge）组成。节点表示任务或操作，边表示节点之间的关系或数据流。\n",
    "\n",
    "Node我就简单粗暴地理解为函数(Function)，而state是函数的输入输出。到了某个edge（END）时，表示图的执行结束，输出结果。\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph是某种由所有参与方都能看到的共享知识库（shared knowledge base），所有节点和边的信息都存储在图中，供后续节点查询和使用。\n",
    "\n",
    "挺抽象的，和chatGPT学习了几轮之后，一起完成了下面的代码。\n",
    "\n",
    "比较简单的流程：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 用户输入一个主题(topic)。\n",
    "2. 第一个节点(NODE 1)生成与主题的大纲(Outline)。\n",
    "3. 第二个节点(NODE 2)根据大纲生成详细内容(draft)。\n",
    "4. 第三个节点(NODE 3)对内容进行润色(refine），指定风格。\n",
    "\n",
    "实际测试了几轮下来，英文输出比中文好很多，可能是gpt本身的语言能力+我本身习惯用英文提示词？\n",
    "\n",
    "流程完全没问题，挺有意思的。感觉就是把AI给串在一起了。\n",
    "\n",
    "如果是特别简单的应用，应该不依赖框架，也能直接通过输入-输出-输入这样的流动串起来。但是框架给了建造复杂智能体的可能性，等课程学完了可以好好琢磨下。\n",
    "\n",
    "这个agent的课程比往期课程的强度要大，感觉三天时间好紧张，没办法一一完成测试和学习了，只能挑挑拣拣，按照自己的能力和兴趣来学了。"

Safety and privacy are essential: review app permissions, choose devices with strong security updates, stay vigilant against scams, and use built-in safety features such as fall detection and SOS.
