    "## 1. list comprehensions\n",
    "   Python allows you to create lists in a single line using list comprehensions, which is more concise than traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   Without list comprehensions, you would need to use a traditional loop:\n",

    "   for x in range(10):\n",
    "       squares.append(x**2)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Conditional list comprehensions can also be used to filter items:\n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "   print(even_squares)  # Output: [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The most common use for list comprehensions is to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable, optionally filtering items based on a condition. A general syntax for list comprehensions is:\n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   [expression for item in iterable if condition]\n",

    "   a, b, c = [1, 2, 3]\n",

    "## 3. Working with files\n",
    "You can read and write files in Python using the built-in `open()` function, which is more straightforward than in many other languages. The basic syntax for opening a file is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open('file.txt', mode='r', encoding='utf-8')\n",
    "content = f.read()\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`mode` specifies how the file is opened, and `encoding` specifies the character encoding used to read or write the file. However, it's recommended to use a context manager (`with` statement) to handle files, which automatically closes the file after the block is executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently used modes include:\n",
    "- `'r'` - read mode (default)\n",
    "- `'w'` - write mode (overwrites the file)\n",
    "- `'a'` - append mode\n",
    "- `'r+'` - read and write mode\n",
    "- `'x'` - exclusive creation mode\n",
    "- `'b'` - binary mode (e.g., `'rb'`, `'wb')\n",
    "- `'t'` - text mode (default)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you would typically use the `with` statement to open a file, which ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read() #content will be a string containing the file's content\n",
    "```\n",
    "This automatically handles closing the file after the block is executed, which is a common practice in Python to avoid resource leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify the encoding when opening a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also working with other file formats like `Excel`, `Word`, `JSON`, and `CSV` using libraries like `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `python-docx`, and `csv`. These are beyond the scope of this section, but they provide powerful tools for data manipulation and file handling in Python.\n",

    "my_function()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, `my_decorator` is a function that takes another function `func` as an argument and returns a new function `wrapper`. The `wrapper` function adds some behavior before and after calling the original function. The `@my_decorator` syntax is a shorthand for applying the decorator to `my_function`.\n",

    "Quick notes for formatting digits with f-strings:\n",
    "Python uses the `:` character to specify formatting options within f-strings. After the `:` character, you can specify various formatting options such as precision, alignment, and type conversion. For example, to format a floating-point number to two decimal places, you can use `:.2f`. To add a thousands separator, you can use `:,` along with the desired precision. These are called \"format specifiers\" and they allow you to control how the value is displayed in the string. Here are some common format specifiers:\n",
    "- `:.2f` - Formats a floating-point number to two decimal places.\n",
    "- `:,` - Adds a thousands separator to large numbers.\n",
    "- `:d` - Formats an integer as a decimal number.\n",
    "- `:s` - Formats a string.\n",
    "The order of the format specifiers matters, so you can combine them as needed. For example, `f\"{value:,.2f}\"` formats a floating-point number with two decimal places and adds a thousands separator.\n",
    "The correct order for all specifiers is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f\"{value:width.precision:type}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `value` is the variable or expression you want to format.\n",
    "- `:` specifies the start of the format specifier.\n",
    "- `width` is the minimum width of the formatted value (optional).\n",
    "- `precision` is the number of digits after the decimal point (optional).\n",
    "- `type` is the type of formatting you want to apply (e.g., `f` for floating-point numbers, `d` for integers, `s` for strings, etc.).  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of formatting a floating-point number with two decimal places and a thousands separator\n",

    "## 6. Lambda functions\n",
    "Python allows you to create small anonymous functions using the `lambda` keyword, which can be useful for short, one-off functions. The basic syntax of a lambda function is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where `arguments` are the input parameters and `expression` is the single expression that the function evaluates and returns. Lambda functions can take multiple arguments, but they can only contain a single expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of using lambda functions is to create small, throwaway functions that can be defined in a single line. They are often used when you need a simple function for a short period of time, such as when passing a function as an argument to another function. Compared to regular functions defined with `def`, lambda functions are more concise and can be used in places where a function is required but you don't want to formally define it.\n",
    "An example to illustrate the difference:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Regular function\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y  \n",
    "# Lambda function\n",
    "add_lambda = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "print(add(3, 4))  # Output: 7\n",
    "print(add_lambda(3, 4))  # Output: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is particularly useful in functional programming contexts, such as when using functions like `map`, `filter`, or `sorted` that require a function as an argument.\n",
    "For example, you can use a lambda function to sort a list of tuples based on the second element:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "points = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 0)]\n",
    "sorted_points = sorted(points, key=lambda point: point[1]) #key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element. In this case, it extracts the second element of each tuple for sorting.\n",
    "print(sorted_points)  # Output: [(5, 0), (3, 1), (1, 2)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "To achieve the same result with a regular function, you would need to define a separate function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_second_element(point):\n",
    "    return point[1]\n",
    "points = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 0)]\n",
    "sorted_points = sorted(points, key=get_second_element)\n",
    "print(sorted_points)  # Output: [(5, 0), (3, 1), (1, 2)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions can take multiple arguments:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "   print(add(3, 4))  # Output: 7\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "You can also use lambda functions with built-in functions like `sorted`:\n",

    "   points = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 0)]\n",
