    "## Numpy Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to import the Numpy library to use its functionalities. Numpy is a powerful library for numerical computations in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Numpy Operations\n",
    "To create a Numpy array, we can use the `np.array()` function. This function takes a list or tuple as input and converts it into a Numpy array. The syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "some_array = np.array([some_list])\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a Numpy array from the provided list. To create a multi-dimensional array, we can pass a nested list or tuple to the `np.array()` function. For example:   \n",
    "\n",
    "multi_dimensional_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a 2D Numpy array with two rows and three columns (2x3). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some basic operations you can perform with Numpy arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np  \n",
    "# Create a Numpy array\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) #Arrays are the core data structure in Numpy, allowing for efficient storage and manipulation of numerical data. \n",
    "print(arr)  # Output: [1 2 3 4 5]\n",
    "# Create a multi-dimensional array\n",
    "multi_dimensional_arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])  # Creating a 2D array with two rows and three columns\n",
    "print(multi_dimensional_arr)  # Output: [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`Broadcasting` is a powerful feature in Numpy that allows you to perform operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes. It automatically expands the smaller array to match the shape of the larger array, enabling element-wise operations without the need for explicit loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Perform element-wise operations\n",
    "arr_squared = arr ** 2  # Squaring each element. You use broadcasting to operate on arrays of different shapes and sizes. Valid operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
    "print(arr_squared)  # Output: [ 1  4  9 16 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Arrays can be `modified and reshaped` without changing their data. This is useful for preparing data for various operations, such as matrix multiplication or statistical analysis.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Reshape the array\n",
    "reshaped_arr = arr.reshape(5, 1)  # Reshaping to a 2D array with 5 rows and 1 column\n",
    "print(reshaped_arr)  # Output: [[1] [2] [3] [4] [5]]\n",
    "# Editing an element\n",
    "reshaped_arr[0, 0] = 10  # Changing the first element to 10\n",
    "print(reshaped_arr)  # Output: [[10] [ 2] [ 3] [ 4] [ 5]]\n",
    "# Slicing the array\n",
    "sliced_arr = reshaped_arr[1:4, 0]  # Slicing the array to get elements from index 1 to 3 by row\n",
    "print(sliced_arr)  # Output: [2 3 4]\n",
