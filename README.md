# A Study Note for Non-technical Folks

This repository contains my study notes on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). My goal is to document my learning process and create a resource for other non-technical individuals who are interested in this topic.

Some of the materials are based on the RAG course from deeplearning.ai. I am grateful for their high-quality content.
