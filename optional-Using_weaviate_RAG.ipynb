    "There are many vector databases available, and Weaviate is one of them. It's demonstrated in DeepLearning.AI's course on RAG so I used it here as well. The workflow is similar to other vector databases, so you can (supposedly) easily switch to another one if you prefer.\n",

    "1. `Set up the vector database`: This involves creating a connection to the database and defining the schema for your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Load data into the vector database`: This step involves ingesting your data into the database, which may include text, images, or other types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Create sparse vectors for keyword search`: This step involves generating sparse vectors (e.g., TF-IDF or bag-of-words) for your data, which allows for keyword-based search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Create dense vectors for semantic search`: This step involves generating embeddings for your data, which allows for semantic search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Create HNSW index to power ANN`: This step involves creating an index that enables approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, which is essential for efficient retrieval of similar items in large datasets."
